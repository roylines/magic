Whenever the topic of flea circuses comes up, Walt Noon's name is not far behind. 
He is the undisputed master of this lost art. 
He has built tonnes of them, and what he doesn't know probably isn't worth knowing.

When you see flea circuses for sale they are often described as "Walt Noon style" or "Built using a Walt Noon design", 
but where do these designs come from and how can you build your own? 
Well just head over to [Walt's website](http://www.noonco.com/flea/plans.htm) and order yourself a copy of his complete flea circus package. 
The package comes in three parts: a DVD, a CD and a manual providing you with enough information to build your own "humbug" flea circus.

###The Manual
The manual is titled "The Mystery In Unveiled! Walt Noon's How To Make A Flea Circus" and 
begins with an introduction explaining what you can expect to find on the CD and DVD along with a bit of history 
about flea circuses and the levels of research Walt undertook to learn about this lost art. 
It's actually a companion to the DVD providing drawings and additional notes on the construction of each of the main "events" 
of the circus as well as listing several U.S. suppliers that can help you acquire the parts required to build the gimmicks.

###The CD
The CD is a pretty eclectic selection of flea related information. 
It includes music that you can use when performing your circus, along with images and high resolution scans of backgrounds 
all of which can be used in construction.

###The DVD
The DVD is what we've all been waiting for. 
It begins with some real turn of the century footage of a real flea circus, 
followed by the step-by-step instructions covering how to build your own, 
ending with some footage of flea training and a television appearance. 
The step-by-step instructions are extremely detailed covering such topics as: choosing a suitable suitcase,
construction of the flea parade, cannon, pool, high-dive, high wire, trapeze and a few additional ideas at the end.
The methods at times are quite ingenious, with some great results (my favourite being the cannon), 
and although a few power tools are required I would say that the skills required should not put anyone off. 
I believe anyone with some time and a little patience could construct one. 
As Walt points out in the commentary the intention of the guide is not to follow it religiously but to be inspired 
and take ideas to make your own unique circus.

Walt is an engaging presenter and his style makes you feel like a friend watching him at work in his workshop 
and his enthusiasm for the topic leaps of the screen. 

I really enjoyed this rather unusual collection and suggest you [get a copy](http://www.noonco.com/flea/plans.htm) 
if you are in anyway interested in this lost art.

Finally the best description of the Flea Circus package comes from Walt himself from an email he sent me:
> The Flea Circus package has been a huge, consuming labor of love for me.
So, you'll find hundreds of meg of material collected and generated over the last 10 years on the CD and DVD.
It's as much a collection of everything entertaining with fleas and projects as it is a step by step to help you build a circus.
I hope you enjoy it very much! Thanks! (The fleas thank you as well.)
