The other evening I received a lovely email from a gentleman from Massachusetts who attended one of the last 
flea circus acts as it toured the USA in the early sixties. 

He recounted in vivid detail his memories of the show, and wanted to share his experience with me. 

What follows is his email in full:

### Memories
When I was around 14-15 I went to an event called "The Springfield Esposition" which still runs today. 
A man who gave us transportation to the fair told us to go over to a trailer, 
and that it would cost us $5.00 (which was a lot of money back in 1961-62) and see a flea circus. 
 
He told us that we'll never again see another one. 
 
The owner of the trailer explained how fleas have a very short life span and that their training takes proportionately a large amount of their life. 
I say it like that because I don't actually remember the actual span of time for either of those things just mentioned. 

It was well worth it and quite enjoyable. 
The owner held a large magnifying glass from behind a half circular table allowing access for everyone to view. 
He had containers with fleas inside and one-by-one removed them by their harnesses in order for them to perform. 

He had a race track where they raced around a small mock-up of a stock car racetrack, 
a football field where the fleas were placed on their backs in an attempt to kick field goals 
which was a tin foil ball placed onto their tiny feet. 
Now, I enjoy American football and they didn't fair out quite as well as some of the field goal kickers of today's teams, 
but they evidently didn't practice a great deal either.
 
I was telling my work partner about seeing the flea circus and he thought I was lying to him. 
Seemed pretty unbelievable to him and if I hadn't seen it I might have had difficulty believing it also. 
He's 72 yrs. old and I figured that he would have been around during the days where there must have been a good number of these shows around.  Not so though!   Oh, well just thought I would write and tell you this stuff."

### Finally
Thank you so much, Dick, for sharing your memories with me, and if there are any other readers who remember flea circuses 
please get in touch.
